# CirclingShooters
A library for the Deltarune fan-engine, Kristal, that implements circles of bullets and bullets that shoot bullets.

## Instructions
If you're unaware how libraries in Kristal work, read their documentation for a quick rundown: https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/wiki/Mod-Information#libraries

If you're already familiar, `circledbullets.lua` and `shooterpellet.lua` under `scripts\battle\bullets\` are what this library implements.  

For a wave that uses both as an example, `circling_shooters.lua` under `scripts\battle\waves\` is waht you'll want to take a look at.
